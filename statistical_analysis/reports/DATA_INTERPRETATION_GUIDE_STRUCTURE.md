# MOT Delta Analysis: Data Interpretation Guide Structure

## Recommended Organization

This document outlines the recommended structure for organizing interpretation guides to maximize educational value and practical application.

---

## 1. OVERARCHING GUIDE: `DATA_INTERPRETATION_GUIDE.md`

**Purpose**: Universal insights applicable across all events and performance levels. General knowledge about developmental patterns in competitive swimming.

**Audience**: Researchers, coaches, NGB officers, anyone seeking to understand the broader patterns in swimmer development.

### What Belongs Here:

#### A. **Universal Patterns Across All Events**
- **Age Transition Patterns**: 75.6% of negatives at 17→18, 19.2% at 16→17, 5.2% at 15→16
- **Gender Patterns**: 72.1% female vs 27.9% male negative improvements
- **Z-Score Range Patterns**: Which ranges show what patterns across all events
- **Reappearance Patterns**: ~30% of dropouts return (universal finding)

#### B. **Methodology Explanations**
- What are z-scores and why they matter
- How improvement deltas are calculated
- Understanding sample sizes and matching
- Survivorship bias explanation

#### C. **High-Level MOT Implications**
- Conservative expectations for 17→18 transitions
- Need for tiered standards
- Gender-specific considerations
- Performance-level specific considerations

#### D. **Cross-Event Comparisons**
- Distance events vs sprint events
- Stroke events vs freestyle
- Event-specific characteristics (when comparing across events)

## 2. EVENT-SPECIFIC REPORTS: `{Gender}_{Event}_MOT_Delta_Analysis.html`

**Purpose**: Actionable, event-specific insights directly applicable to creating MOT times for that specific event/gender combination.

**Audience**: MOT table creators, event-specific coaches, analysts determining progression standards.

### What Belongs Here:

#### A. **That Event's Specific Data**
- Canada On Track reference times for that event
- USA improvement statistics for that event
- Reappearance data for that event (how many drop out, how many return)
- Z-score range analysis for that event's transitions

#### B. **Event-Specific Patterns**
- "This event shows X pattern because..."
- "Unlike other events, this event shows..."
- Event-specific severity of regression
- Event-specific z-score patterns

#### C. **Direct MOT Recommendations**
- Recommended delta values for each transition (15→16, 16→17, 17→18)
- How this event compares to Canada tracks
- Suggested MOT progression times based on analysis
- Confidence levels and ranges for each transition

#### D. **Event-Specific Warnings/Considerations**
- "This event shows severe regression at 17→18 in Average range"
- "Female swimmers in this event show unique challenges at..."
- "This event's reappearance rate suggests..."

## 3. DISTINCTION: General Knowledge vs MOT Application

### **General Knowledge** (Overarching Guide)
- Understanding WHY patterns exist
- Learning about developmental phases
- Comparing male vs female patterns
- Understanding z-score distributions
- Learning about attrition and reappearance
- Scientific/educational insights

**Example**: "Female swimmers show 2.6× more negative improvements than males. This suggests different developmental trajectories, potentially related to physical maturation, training responses, or competitive dynamics."

### **MOT Application** (Event-Specific Reports)
- WHAT delta values to use
- HOW to set progression times
- WHICH Canada track to reference
- WHAT confidence level to apply
- HOW to adjust for this event's unique characteristics

**Example**: "For F 50 Free 17→18 transition, use a conservative delta of 0.00s to -0.11s, as this event shows 11 negative improvements across 8 z-score ranges, with an average regression of -0.086s."

## 4. CURRENT STATUS

### ✅ Already in Overarching Guide (`DATA_INTERPRETATION_GUIDE.md`):
- Universal age transition patterns
- Universal z-score range patterns
- Reappearance patterns
- Gender patterns (just added)
- Methodology explanations
- High-level MOT implications

### ✅ Already in Event-Specific Reports:
- Canada On Track data
- USA statistics
- Z-score analysis by transition
- Reappearance data (just added)
- Z-score pattern analysis (just added)
- USA vs Canada comparison

### ⚠️ NEEDS ADDITION:
- **Event-Specific Summary Section** in each report highlighting:
  - This event's unique characteristics
  - How this event differs from general patterns
  - Specific MOT recommendations with reasoning
  - Event-specific warnings

---

## 5. RECOMMENDED ADDITIONS TO EVENT-SPECIFIC REPORTS

Add a new section after Section 7 (Analysis & Recommendations):

**Section 8: Event-Specific Insights & MOT Recommendations**

This section should include:
1. **How This Event Compares to Overall Patterns**
   - "This event shows [X] negative improvements, which is [above/below/at] the average"
   - "Unlike the general pattern where [X], this event shows [Y]"
   
2. **Event-Specific Gender Characteristics**
   - If this is a female event: "This event contributes X% of all female negative improvements"
   - If this is a male event: "This event shows [X] pattern, which differs from female events"

3. **Direct MOT Delta Recommendations**
   - "Based on this analysis, recommend the following deltas:"
   - "15→16: [value]s (confidence: [high/medium/low], based on [reason])"
   - "16→17: [value]s (confidence: [high/medium/low], based on [reason])"
   - "17→18: [value]s (confidence: [high/medium/low], based on [reason])"

4. **Event-Specific Considerations**
   - Distance/technical characteristics affecting progression
   - Unique challenges at specific transitions
   - Z-score ranges requiring special attention

## 6. SUMMARY

**Overarching Guide** = "Learn about swimming development patterns"
**Event-Specific Reports** = "Create MOT times for this specific event"

Both are essential, but serve different purposes:
- Overarching guide educates and provides context
- Event-specific reports provide actionable recommendations

The key is ensuring each piece of information appears in the most appropriate place based on its generality vs. specificity.
