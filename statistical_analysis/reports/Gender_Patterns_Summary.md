# Gender Patterns in Negative Improvements: Summary Table

## Quick Reference: Key Gender Statistics

| Metric | Female | Male | Key Insight |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| **Total Negative Improvements** | 124 (72.1%) | 48 (27.9%) | Female events show 2.6× more negative improvements |
| **Average Median Regression** | -0.803s | -0.944s | Male regression more severe when it occurs |
| **Most Severe Regression** | -5.710s | -10.345s (M 800 Free, Average range) | Male events show extreme outliers |
| **% Improving** | 40.2% | 42.3% | Similar improvement rates |
| **% Getting Slower** | 59.5% | 57.4% | Similar slowdown rates |

## By Age Transition

| Transition | Female % | Male % | Female Avg Median | Male Avg Median |
|------------|----------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **15→16** | 88.9% | 11.1% | -1.104s | -0.780s |
| **16→17** | 78.8% | 21.2% | -0.420s | -0.954s |
| **17→18** | 69.2% | 30.8% | -0.887s | -0.946s |

**Key Pattern**: Female events dominate negative improvements at earlier transitions (15→16, 16→17), but the gap narrows at 17→18 where both genders show significant issues.

## By Z-Score Range

| Z-Score Range | Female Count | Male Count | Female Avg Median | Male Avg Median |
|---------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Above Average (0.5-1.0 z)** | 22 (68.8%) | 10 (31.2%) | -1.171s | -0.502s |
| **Average (0-0.5 z)** | 12 (66.7%) | 6 (33.3%) | -0.548s | **-3.051s** ⚠️ |
| **Top 6.7% (1.5-2.0 z)** | 21 (70.0%) | 9 (30.0%) | -0.838s | -1.093s |
| **Top 15.9% (1.0-1.5 z)** | 21 (80.8%) | 5 (19.2%) | -0.713s | -0.291s |
| **Top 2.5% (≥2.0 z)** | 15 (62.5%) | 9 (37.5%) | -0.465s | -0.595s |
| **Below Average (-0.5-0 z)** | 11 (57.9%) | 8 (42.1%) | -1.168s | -0.398s |
| **Lower (-1.0 to -0.5 z)** | 13 (100%) | 0 (0%) | -0.845s | — |
| **Bottom 15.9% (<-1.0 z)** | 9 (90.0%) | 1 (10.0%) | -0.429s | -2.140s |

**Key Findings:**
- ⚠️ **Male Average range shows extreme regression**: -3.051s (vs -0.548s for females)
- **Lower range (z -1.0 to -0.5)**: 100% female - no male negative improvements in this range
- **Elite ranges**: More balanced, but females still more frequent

## Top Events by Gender

### Female Events (Most Affected)
1. **F 100 Breast**: 11 negative improvements, -0.616s avg
2. **F 200 IM**: 11 negative improvements, -0.370s avg
3. **F 50 Free**: 11 negative improvements, -0.086s avg
4. **F 200 Fly**: 10 negative improvements, -0.602s avg
5. **F 200 Breast**: 10 negative improvements, -1.144s avg

### Male Events (Most Affected)
1. **M 800 Free**: 5 negative improvements, **-3.320s avg** ⚠️
2. **M 1500 Free**: 3 negative improvements, **-4.268s avg** ⚠️
3. **M 200 Back**: 5 negative improvements, -0.216s avg
4. **M 200 Breast**: 5 negative improvements, -0.482s avg
5. **M 400 IM**: 4 negative improvements, -1.229s avg

**Key Insight**: Male distance events show extreme regression when negative improvements occur.

## MOT Implications

### For Female Events:
- More frequent negative improvements require **conservative expectations** at all transitions
- Pay particular attention to Lower z-score range (-1.0 to -0.5) where 100% of negatives are female
- Early transitions (15→16, 16→17) show higher female representation in negatives

### For Male Events:
- Less frequent but more severe when they occur
- **Critical attention needed** for Average range (0-0.5 z) where regression is extreme (-3.051s)
- Distance events (800 Free, 1500 Free) show catastrophic regression patterns
- Consider tiered standards for middle-performing male swimmers

## Comparison: Frequency vs Severity

| Aspect | Female | Male |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Frequency** | Higher (72.1%) | Lower (27.9%) |
| **Severity** | Moderate (-0.803s avg) | More Severe (-0.944s avg) |
| **Distribution** | Across all ranges | Concentrated in specific ranges |
| **Critical Range** | Lower (-1.0 to -0.5 z) | Average (0-0.5 z) |
