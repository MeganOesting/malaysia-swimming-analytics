# Understanding Improvement Patterns by Performance Level
## A Plain Language Guide for Parents, Athletes, and NGB Officers

## 📊 What is a Z-Score?

**Simple explanation:** A z-score tells you how good a swimmer's time is compared to everyone else their age.

- **Positive z-score:** Faster than average (good!)
- **Zero z-score:** Exactly average
- **Negative z-score:** Slower than average

**Example:** A swimmer with a z-score of +1.5 is faster than about 93% of swimmers their age. A z-score of +2.0 means they're faster than about 98% of swimmers.

## 🔍 What We Discovered: The 1.5-2.0 Z-Score Pattern

### The Key Finding

We analyzed **80 different age transitions** (different events, genders, and ages) to see how swimmers improve. We looked specifically at swimmers in the **top 6.7%** (z-scores between 1.5 and 2.0).

**What we found:**
- **66%** of these elite swimmers showed improvement (got faster)
- **34%** showed no improvement or got slower
- But this varied dramatically by age!

### Age Matters!

**At age 15→16:**
- **96% of elite swimmers improved** (25 out of 26 transitions)
- Nearly all top performers get faster during this transition

**At age 16→17:**
- **62% of elite swimmers improved** (16 out of 26 transitions)
- Still majority improving, but less consistent

**At age 17→18:**
- **Only 43% of elite swimmers improved** (12 out of 28 transitions)
- Most elite swimmers plateau or slow down at this age

## 💡 What This Means for Swimmers and Coaches

### For Parents and Athletes

**Good News:**
- If your swimmer is already in the top 6.7% at age 15, they're very likely (96%) to improve by age 16
- Elite performance at a young age is a strong indicator of continued progress

**Reality Check:**
- By age 17-18, even elite swimmers often plateau
- This is normal! Most swimmers reach peak improvement rates earlier

### For NGB Officers and Coaches

**Identifying "On Track" Swimmers:**
- Swimmers with z-scores between 1.5-2.0 at age 15-16 are most likely to continue improving
- These swimmers should be prioritized for development programs
- Focus resources on swimmers showing this elite performance level early

**Setting Realistic Expectations:**
- Don't expect all swimmers to improve every year
- Elite swimmers are more consistent, but even they plateau by 17-18
- Use this data to set appropriate MOT (Malaysia On Track) targets

## 📈 Understanding Correlation

### What is Correlation?

Correlation measures how two things relate to each other:

- **Positive correlation (+):** When one thing goes up, the other goes up too
  - *Example: More practice usually leads to faster times*

- **Negative correlation (-):** When one thing goes up, the other goes down
  - *Example: More stress usually leads to slower performance*

- **No correlation (near 0):** The two things don't relate to each other
  - *Example: Favorite color has nothing to do with swimming speed*

### Our Finding: 1.2% Correlation

We found only a **1.2% positive correlation** between how fast a swimmer is at one age and how much they'll improve the next year.

**What this means:**
- There's almost **no relationship** between starting speed and improvement amount
- Fast swimmers don't necessarily improve more than slow swimmers
- BUT - fast swimmers are **more consistent** in improving (especially at younger ages)

**The Big Picture:**
- While the improvement amount doesn't correlate with starting performance, the **consistency of improvement does**
- Elite swimmers (z-score 1.5-2.0) are more likely to keep improving year after year
- This is why Canada On Track (and MOT) focus on elite performers - they're more reliable in their progression

## 🎯 Implications for Malaysia On Track (MOT)

### Why This Matters

1. **Targeting Elite Performers Works:**
   - Swimmers in the 1.5-2.0 z-score range at age 15-16 are most likely to continue improving
   - This validates using elite trajectories (like Canada On Track) rather than average population data

2. **Age-Specific Expectations:**
   - Expect strong improvement at 15→16 for elite swimmers
   - Moderate improvement at 16→17
   - Limited improvement at 17→18 (this is normal!)

3. **Setting MOT Targets:**
   - MOT should target swimmers already performing at elite levels
   - Don't use average population improvement rates - they include many swimmers who plateau
   - Focus on swimmers who are "on track" for medal potential

## 📝 Real-World Example: F 50 Free

For **Female 50 Free age 17→18:**
- **Overall USA median:** -0.11s (most swimmers got slower)
- **Elite swimmers (z 1.5-2.0):** +0.07s improvement (62.5% improved)
- **Canada Track 1:** 0.20s improvement target

**Takeaway:** The median USA swimmer got slower, but elite swimmers (the ones we want to identify) still improved. This is why MOT needs to target elite performers, not the average!

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this mean slower swimmers can't improve?**
A: No! Slower swimmers can absolutely improve. The data shows that improvement amount doesn't strongly correlate with starting speed. However, elite swimmers are more **consistent** in their improvement year-over-year.

**Q: Should we only focus on top 6.7% swimmers?**
A: Not necessarily. This data helps identify which swimmers are most likely to continue improving, but development programs should support all motivated athletes. However, for "on track" identification (MOT), focusing on elite performers makes sense.

**Q: Why do swimmers plateau at 17-18?**
A: This is normal! Physical development slows, and many swimmers reach peak performance during these years. Even elite swimmers experience this.

**Q: What about swimmers outside the 1.5-2.0 range?**
A: They can still improve! But our data shows that swimmers in this range are most consistent in their year-over-year improvement, especially at younger ages.

## 📚 Technical Notes

- **Data Source:** USA Swimming season rankings (top 500 per age/event/gender)
- **Ages:** USA Swimming ages (age on first day of competition, not birth year age)
- **Z-Score Calculation:** Relative to distribution at each starting age
- **Improvement Delta:** Time at younger age minus time at older age (positive = improvement)
