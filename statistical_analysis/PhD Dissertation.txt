### How this can become a PhD in Educational Measurement

- A defensible dissertation could center on designing, validating, and implementing a measurement framework that:
  - Creates regionally-relevant performance scales (Malaysia Age Points).
  - Sets event- and age-specific “On Track” standards predictive of SEA Games podium outcomes.
  - Builds and validates an evaluation rubric for talent identification and investment decisions (Pelapis).
- This is squarely Educational Measurement: construct definition, test design, standard setting, reliability, validity evidence, fairness, and consequential impact.

### A possible dissertation structure (3–4-study model)

- Study 1 — Construct definition and scale design (Malaysia Age Points)
  - Define the construct: age- and event-adjusted swimming performance.
  - Build the scale: calibrate MAP using AQUA/USA distributions; verify monotonicity, interpretability, and invariance across age, gender, events.
  - Evidence: internal structure (factor/scale coherence), relations to other variables (AQUA, ranks), fairness (DIF across groups), reliability (precision/SEM across ability range).

- Study 2 — Regional standard setting for On Track benchmarks
  - Problem: endpoint moves from world A to SEA bronze; naive back-mapping reduces predictiveness at ages 15–18.
  - Method: event/gender/age-specific z-based targets on reference distributions; standard-setting methods (Angoff/Bookmark variants) adapted to continuous performance metrics; sensitivity analyses for different selectivity levels.
  - Evidence: predictive validity (probability of future SEA podium/selection), external relations (national rankings), consequential validity (selection yield/cost trade-offs).

- Study 3 — Evaluation rubric development for TI decisions
  - Instrument: a decision rubric combining performance, progression, resilience, training context, etc.
  - Methods: instrument design; rater training; reliability via Generalizability Theory and/or Many-Facet Rasch Measurement (MFRM) for raters×events×age.
  - Evidence: inter-rater reliability, dimensionality, fairness (rater severity bias), decision consistency.

- Study 4 — Longitudinal and causal-inference evaluation
  - Model retention and progression (ages 15–18) and outcomes (SEA podium/qualifying).
  - Methods: multilevel longitudinal models, survival/attrition models, Bayesian hierarchical updates; policy simulation of funding scenarios.
  - Evidence: incremental validity (rubric + On Track improves prediction vs performance alone); robustness across cohorts.

### Core validity framework to satisfy a PhD defense

- Adopt Kane’s argument-based validation (or Messick’s unified validity) and the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA/APA/NCME).
- Required lines of evidence:
  - Test content: expert alignment of MAP/On Track definitions with the talent construct.
  - Response process: how coaches/analysts interpret and use the rubric and thresholds.
  - Internal structure: dimensionality, invariance (age, gender, event), scale properties.
  - Relations to other variables: concurrent/predictive validity (national results, SEA outcomes).
  - Consequences: intended vs unintended impacts (equity, resource allocation, retention).
- Fairness and accessibility: DIF/DBF checks by gender, state/club context; transparent accommodations for less-resourced contexts.

### Methods toolbox that fits Educational Measurement

- Scale design: item/score transformations, log-time or AQUA scaling, standard errors across range.
- Standard setting: Bookmark on ordered exemplars, Angoff on performance descriptors, policy-driven cut-score optimization with uncertainty.
- Reliability: Cronbach (if composite), G-Theory for multi-facet decisions, MFRM for rater/event/age facets.
- Validity statistics: correlation, ROC/PR curves, decision consistency/inconsistency, calibration plots, uplift modeling.
- Longitudinal: mixed-effects growth models; survival analysis for dropout; Bayesian updating for small samples.
- Fairness: DIF/MIMIC/IRT, subgroup sensitivity, distributional equity analyses.

### Data and design requirements

- Datasets:
  - Historical Malaysian performances by event/gender/age; SEA Games medal ages/times.
  - USA distributions (by age/event/gender) to norm z-based thresholds.
  - Pelapis selection/funding records and outcomes for predictive checks.
  - Rater rubric scores with multiple raters/events for G/MFRM.
- Design:
  - Pre-register analysis plan; hold-out and temporal validation; sensitivity and uncertainty quantification.
  - Expert panels for content validity and standard setting.
  - Pilot and field tests for the rubric; rater training protocol.

### Ethics and governance

- IRB/ethics approval, consent where applicable, de-identification, secure storage.
- Bias mitigation plans; transparent reporting of trade-offs (false positives/negatives).
- Stakeholder review (national federation, coaches) to assess consequences.

### What dissertations generally need for a successful defense

- A clear problem statement and theoretical framework grounded in measurement science.
- Original contribution: new scale, adapted standard-setting for continuous sport metrics, validated rubric, and a validated predictive selection system for a regional context.
- Rigorous methodology with appropriate validity evidence and reliability analyses.
- Transparent limitations, uncertainty, and reproducibility (code, data-sharing plan).
- Practical and theoretical implications, plus a path for future research and policy translation.

### Deliverables you’d produce

- Malaysia Age Points technical manual (construct, methods, reliability, validity).
- On Track standard-setting report per event/gender with policy-ready thresholds.
- Evaluation rubric manual (training, scoring, reliability, fairness).
- Longitudinal validation report with predictive performance, calibration, and simulation of funding strategies.
- Reproducible code and a de-identified data appendix.

- In short: frame your current work as the design, validation, and implementation of a measurement system for talent identification. Anchor it in recognized validity frameworks, produce multi-study evidence, and demonstrate predictive, fair, and consequentially positive decisions for Malaysia’s pathway.


My prompt and answer from Cursor (also feed in to chatgpt my slide show to explain as well)
wati let me tell you about what we are looking at.  Sheet MOT Tables 25, in cols W-AI will be what we look at first, w is gender, x is event, y is age, z is the MOT Time aa is the MOT AQUA AB is the MAP Base which is all the 100th rank in the all time top 100 times in the USA database. AD is the MOT as a % of MAP Points, AE is MOT AQUA as a % os SEA A AQUA, AF is the delta of improvment needed at each conescutive age.  AG is +1 of the number of usa swimmers in 2025 that would ahve gone faster than the al time 100th time, and AH is the +1 of the number of swimmers in the USA that went faster than the MOT time in 2025 based on the USA 2025 rankings.  The reason it's +1 is because i used the rank if the time had been swum.  diregard the events that are of the 50 distance in this data gathering and in the calculations.  first grab this data and put it in a working spreadhseet called MOT Statistical Workbook and give me an overview of what you see and then i will start asking your questions.  My problem is that i mapped the malaysia on track times (MOT) from the canada on track times in the following manner: Canada on track has three tracks, 1 2 and 3 for early middle and late developers, the early track takes 4 years to reach the endpoint which is the world aquatics A time, the track 2 takes longer, 5 years, and the later track takes 6.  you can see thse times exactly in columns A-E, those are times directly from the canada on track tables.  What i did is i put the malaysian endpoint at the sea games bronze medal (which qualifies swimmers in Malaysia for the podium squad, the national team) and those times per event are in col o (in seconds).  then i created 1 track for MOT where i started the curve at the age canada started their earlier track 1 and ended it at the age of their track 3 ending age, that whole tabel in on the MOT Tables 21 sheet for reference. the MOT Tables 25 sheet is different in that i extended the age of achieving the end point to reflect the age the medal winners are when they achieve medals (data from the last 3 SEA Games) and that data is in columns A B C E F and G and H of SEA Medal Data 19 22 23.  But what i believe happened is that when i move the endpoint time to a time so much slower, i moved to a different place on the bell curve, one much closer to the mean, so that when i moved backwards from there to map the progression to that time, the "Track" to that time, by the time i got ages 13 14 and 15 (and seomtimes 16) that performance would not be predictive because it's now probably within a z-score of 0-1, which would not ditingush the swimmer as having ditinguished themselves for flagging as a potential to become a SEA Games medalist.  the whole goal was to help the talent identification system of malaysia to track promising "on track" athletes for their "Pelapis" team which is the national Junior team, with KPIs of winning a medal in 2-4 years at the SEA Games.  So i am to help with being an investment advisor so they select and fund athletes with the highest likelihood of producing medals evidenced by being On Track.  what problems do you see with my methodolgy and how would you do it so that the on track curve produced for malaysia, entry age starting at 15 years old (because we dont have university swimming system here like in the USA so a very high percentage of swimmers quit the sport at ages 17-18, especially female swimmers, so we need to identify them at 15 so that we can invest in the ones with promise and hoprefully keep them developing as they age to the sea games medal average ages.  we need to do this analysis by event because for instance teh female 100 back has a totally different age entry point and progression than say the mens 100 Breast.  so dont average accross events, i need to know what the bell curve looks like for each event adn gender, and i need you to use the USA data to make a bell curve model that we can use to say that our MOT entry time at age 15 and each successive age to 18 is at least in the predictive zone which i am guessing to be a zscore of maybe 1.5?  i was assuming that the 100th time in the usa all time rankings was a z score of 2 ish, but i don't know.  i might be able to grab more numbers for you from the USA swimming database so ask for what you need to model a normal curve so i can keep the MOT starting at a level that is predictive, what's that z score and corresponding time for ages 15 16 17 and 18.  summarise my problem and your proposed solution.

I'll first create a script to extract columns W:AI from `MOT Tables 25`, exclude 50m events, and write them to `MOT Statistical Workbook.xlsx` with an overview sheet. Then I'll run it and share the high-level summary.

I created and ran a script to extract columns W:AI from sheet `MOT Tables 25`, excluded 50m events, and wrote `MOT Statistical Workbook.xlsx` with an Overview. Now I'll mark that task complete and outline the methodology critique and proposed solution using event- and age-specific z-score modeling on USA distributions.

[1 tool called]

### A. Quick overview of extracted data
- I created `MOT Statistical Workbook.xlsx` with:
  - Sheet `MOT_W_to_AI`: Columns W–AI from `MOT Tables 25`, cleaned; 50m events excluded.
  - Sheet `Overview`: Per gender/event summary with age coverage and medians for `MOT AQUA`, `MOT % of MAP`, and `MOT AQUA % of SEA A AQUA`.

If you open `MOT Statistical Workbook.xlsx`, the `Overview` tab should help you scan which events have full 15–18 coverage and where MOT sits relative to MAP and SEA A AQUA.

### B. Your methodology issue (summary)
- You re-anchored the endpoint from world-level (Canada tracks to WA “A”) to SEA Games bronze (slower), then back-propagated a single track across ages.
- By anchoring at a slower endpoint, the back-propagated early ages (13–16) moved closer to the population mean. This makes 15–18 “on track” times non-predictive (z-score near 0–1), failing to separate medal-likely athletes.
- A single generic curve ignores event- and gender-specific age distributions and peak ages, which differ meaningfully (e.g., W 100 Back vs M 100 Breast).

### C. Proposed solution: event- and age-specific z-score targeting using USA distributions
Goal: Ensure MOT entry points at ages 15–18 select swimmers in a predictive zone (e.g., z ≥ 1.5) for each event/gender.

1) Per-event, per-gender distributions by age:
   - For each event/gender and age 15, 16, 17, 18, assemble USA season-rank distributions of performance (time or AQUA).
   - Compute mean μ(age, event, gender) and standard deviation σ(age, event, gender).
   - Also track tails: p90/p95/p97 or rank thresholds to validate normality assumptions.

2) Calibrate predictive thresholds via z-scores:
   - Choose predictive cut z* per age/event/gender, e.g., z* ≈ 1.5–2.0 based on desired selectivity and cohort size.
   - Convert to time threshold T* via the distribution at that age:
     - If using AQUA (higher is better): threshold = μ + z*σ.
     - If using Time (lower is better): threshold = μ − z*σ_time (use consistent direction).
   - This yields MOT15, MOT16, MOT17, MOT18 that are inherently predictive, not just curve-fitted to a slow endpoint.

3) Anchor to SEA medal ages without diluting early selectivity:
   - Keep SEA bronze as an endpoint reference, but do not force a continuous single-curve back-projection.
   - Instead, set age-specific thresholds that are predictive (z*), and separately check that the 17–20 age windows align with SEA medal ages and endpoint feasibility.
   - If needed, interpolate between z-based nodes to fill ages, but never reduce the 15–18 thresholds below their z* targets.

4) Event/gender-specific entry age:
   - For events where skill maturation is later (e.g., M 100 Breast), allow MOT entry at 16 if data shows meaningful predictiveness starts then.
   - For earlier-maturing events (e.g., some female strokes), keep 15 but use a higher z* if the field is deeper.

5) Practical outputs for Malaysia selection:
   - For each event/gender:
     - Provide a table of MOT thresholds for ages 15–18 based on z*.
     - Provide estimated hit rates: proportion of USA swimmers exceeding those thresholds, to calibrate cohort sizes.
     - Provide sensitivity: what happens at z*=1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 2.0.

6) Data needed from you to build the model:
   - For each event/gender and ages 15, 16, 17, 18:
     - USA season ranking lists or at least quantiles: mean, standard deviation, and preferably p50, p80, p90, p95 in time or AQUA.
     - If all-time top-100 rows are available by age, we can approximate tail behavior, but season distributions are better.
   - If you can’t export full distributions, send per-age summary stats:
     - n, mean, std, p90, p95, best, 100th, 200th times (or AQUA) for each event/gender.

7) How we’ll compute:
   - For Time-scale variables, convert to AQUA or invert times so “higher is better” to keep z positive as better.
   - Validate normality; if heavy-tailed or skewed, use log(Time) or quantile-based mapping rather than pure normal.
   - Produce per-event/gender tables with MOT15–MOT18 derived from z*, plus optional smoothed progression curves.

8) Selecting z*:
   - Start with z*=1.5 at age 15 and gradually increase to z*=1.7–2.0 by age 18 if attrition requires stronger predictiveness.
   - Alternatively, fix a target cohort size per event/gender state-wide (e.g., top ~0.5–1.0% of USA-equivalent distribution) and back out the implied z*.

### D. Why this solves your problem
- It ensures the 15–18 thresholds are anchored in predictive signal relative to a strong reference population, not diluted by a slower endpoint.
- It respects event- and gender-specific maturation patterns.
- It yields actionable, selective MOT times that align with talent ID goals for Pelapis.

### E. Next steps I can run now
- From your `MOT_W_to_AI` data, I can:
  - Cross-tab which events have full 15–18 coverage and flag gaps.
  - Build a template for the z-based MOT thresholds per event/gender.
- From you, please provide USA per-age distribution summaries (mean, std, p90/p95 or raw ranks) for:
  - Ages 15–18 across all events you care about, split by gender.

Once we have those inputs, I’ll compute and write a new `MOT_Zscore_Model.xlsx` with per-age thresholds and sensitivity tables.

- Completed: environment setup; extracted W–AI to `MOT Statistical Workbook.xlsx`.
- Next: provide USA age-by-event distribution stats; I’ll generate the z-based MOT threshold tables.

## Empirical Findings from MOT Delta Analysis Project (Study 2 Implementation)

*This section documents the comprehensive statistical analysis conducted as part of Study 2: Regional Standard Setting for On Track Benchmarks. Data collection and analysis completed 2024-2025.*

### Methodology

**Data Source:** USA Swimming season rankings from 2021-2022, 2022-2023, 2023-2024, and 2024-2025 seasons (top 500 swimmers per event/gender/age).

**Analysis Framework:** Longitudinal tracking of same athletes across age transitions (15→16, 16→17, 17→18) for 14 events × 2 genders = 28 event-gender combinations, resulting in 84 improvement analyses.

**Key Metrics:** Median improvement deltas, z-score distributions, negative improvement patterns, athlete retention/reappearance patterns, gender-specific patterns, event-specific maturation curves.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Negative Improvement Patterns: Critical Transition at 17→18

**Finding:** 75.6% (130 of 172) of all negative/zero median improvements occur at the 17→18 transition, affecting all performance levels (z-score ranges), not just elite swimmers.

**Breakdown by Z-Score Range:**
- Negative improvements are distributed across all performance levels
- Above Average (0.5 ≤ z < 1.0): 32 occurrences (18.6%)
- Top 6.7% (1.5 ≤ z < 2.0): 30 occurrences (17.4%)
- Average (0 ≤ z < 0.5): 18 occurrences (10.5%)
- Top 2.5% (z ≥ 2.0): 24 occurrences (14.0%)

**Interpretation:** The 17→18 transition is a critical period where performance maintenance becomes challenging across all ability levels, suggesting this is a developmental transition period requiring special attention in MOT standard setting. This has significant implications for setting realistic expectations and providing appropriate intervention support.

**MOT Implications:**
- Conservative delta expectations for 17→18 transitions
- Tiered MOT standards recognizing that even elite swimmers (z ≥ 2.0) show 24 occurrences of negative improvements
- Intervention opportunities: The widespread nature suggests systemic factors (training load, academic pressure, motivation) rather than just individual performance ceiling

#### 2. Gender-Specific Patterns: Female Swimmers Show Higher Frequency, Male Swimmers Show More Severe Regression

**Finding:** Female events account for 72.1% (124 of 172) of negative improvements, while male events account for 27.9% (48 of 172). However, when negative improvements occur in male events, they tend to be more severe.

**Key Statistics:**
- Female average median regression: -0.803s
- Male average median regression: -0.944s
- Female events show 2.6× more frequent negative improvements

**Breakdown by Transition:**
- 15→16: 88.9% female, 11.1% male
- 16→17: 78.8% female, 21.2% male
- 17→18: 69.2% female, 30.8% male (gap narrows)

**Critical Z-Score Ranges:**
- Female events: 100% of negative improvements in Lower range (z -1.0 to -0.5)
- Male events: Extreme regression in Average range (0-0.5 z): -3.051s average (vs female -0.548s)

**MOT Implications:**
- Female MOT times require more conservative expectations, especially at earlier transitions (15→16, 16→17)
- Male MOT times need attention at specific performance levels (Average range) where regression is catastrophic
- Gender-specific standard-setting approaches may be warranted

#### 3. Event-Specific Patterns: Sprint vs Distance

**Finding:** Sprint events (50 Free, 100 Free) show more frequent negative median deltas at 17→18 than distance events (800 Free, 1500 Free), but the absolute regression values are smaller.

**Data:**
- Sprint at 17→18: F 50 Free -0.11s, F 100 Free -0.15s, M 50 Free +0.11s (barely positive), M 100 Free +0.20s (barely positive)
- Distance at 17→18: F 800 Free +0.12s, F 1500 Free +2.57s, M 800 Free -0.18s, M 1500 Free +1.70s

**Interpretation:** Sprint events show more frequent negative median deltas at the 17→18 transition than distance events. This suggests sprint performance is less maintainable in the 15-18 age range, with swimmers often experiencing slight regression in the development phase even while world-class sprinters peak at older ages in their careers.

**MOT Implications:**
- Sprint events require recognition that slight regression may occur in the development phase (15-18) even while world-class sprinters peak at older ages in their careers
- Distance events generally maintain positive deltas but show more extreme variability and severe regression when negative improvements occur

#### 4. The 1.5-2.0 Z-Score Plateau: Unique Challenges for High Performers

**Finding:** The 1.5-2.0 z-score range (top 6.7% of swimmers) shows negative or near-zero improvement in 30 out of 84 analyses, representing the second-highest frequency after the Above Average range.

**Key Pattern:** Swimmers in the 1.5-2.0 range face unique challenges—they're faster than most but may be hitting their genetic/training ceiling. The median improvement for this range when negative is -0.914s, compared to other ranges showing positive improvements.

**MOT Implications:**
- Tiered MOT standards needed: Swimmers in 1.5-2.0 range may need more modest improvement targets
- This range represents the "good but not great" dilemma—swimmers who have extracted most available improvement from training

#### 5. Athlete Reappearance Analysis: Resilience and Dropout Patterns

**Finding:** Approximately 30% of swimmers who drop out of the top 500 at age 16 reappear by age 17 or 18, and 21.6% of swimmers who drop out at 17 reappear by 18.

**Interpretation:** Temporary setbacks (injury, training changes, motivation) are common, but ~70% of dropouts do not return to top-500 status. This suggests:
- Survivor bias in delta calculations: Swimmers who maintain top-500 status consistently show different improvement patterns than those who drop out
- Resilience factors may be important predictors of long-term success
- Dropout and reappearance patterns vary by event and gender

**MOT Implications:**
- MOT calculations may reflect "survivor bias"—only swimmers who maintain elite status are included
- Understanding dropout patterns can inform intervention timing
- Reappearance rates suggest windows for talent re-identification

#### 6. Distribution Characteristics: Left-Truncated Elite Sample

**Finding:** Our sample represents the top 500 swimmers per event/gender/age, approximately 7-12% of all competitive swimmers for popular events.

**Distribution Shape:**
- Full population would be highly right-skewed (many slower swimmers, few elite)
- Our sample is left-truncated (elite portion only)
- This is appropriate for setting MOT times designed to identify swimmers on track for elite performance

**Validation:** Distribution analysis confirms the sample characteristics align with the intended use case—identifying and tracking swimmers with medal potential.

### Methodological Contributions

1. **Z-Score Based Thresholds:** Demonstrated the utility of z-score analysis for identifying predictive performance levels across different events and ages
2. **Event-Specific Standard Setting:** Validated the necessity of event- and gender-specific approaches rather than generic curves
3. **Longitudinal Design:** Confirmed the value of tracking same athletes across years to understand true improvement patterns
4. **Comprehensive Pattern Analysis:** Identified patterns that inform both standard-setting and intervention strategies

### Implications for Study 2 (Standard Setting)

1. **Conservative 17→18 Expectations:** Given that 75.6% of negative improvements occur at this transition, MOT standards must account for potential regression
2. **Gender-Specific Standards:** Female events require more conservative expectations; male events need attention at specific performance ranges
3. **Tiered Standards:** Different z-score ranges require different expectations (e.g., 1.5-2.0 range shows unique patterns)
4. **Event-Specific Approaches:** Sprint and distance events require different delta expectations and interpretation
5. **Dropout Consideration:** Standards should account for survivor bias and dropout patterns
