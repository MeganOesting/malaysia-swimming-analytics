✅ FIXED: F 100 Back 15→16 delta - Data files were swapped (age 15 in age 18 file, age 18 in age 15 file). Fixed and re-ran analysis.

NEXT PHASE: COMPLETE COMPARISON ANALYSIS AND GENERATE RECOMMENDATIONS
======================================================================

Immediate Tasks:
1. ✅ COMPLETE - Fixed missing F 100 Back 15→16 delta (343 athletes, 0.920s median improvement)
2. Update comparison tool to use SQLite queries (currently using Excel) - NEXT PRIORITY
3. Generate final MOT table reconstruction recommendations based on USA vs Canada comparison
4. Complete track-specific USA vs Canada delta analysis with clear track labeling

KEY PROMPTS FOR NEW SESSIONS:
=============================

"Check my progress - what files do I still need to submit?"
"What critical files am I missing for the 15→16 transitions?"
"Show me the status of my data collection"
"Run the analysis - I'm done submitting data"
"What's the quality of the data I've submitted so far?"

WORKFLOW REMINDERS:
===================

1. DATA SUBMISSION:
