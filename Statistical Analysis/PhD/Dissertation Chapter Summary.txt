You will want to add the track evaluation of the Rubric and something about wrapping my curriculum in there and how that relates, what is the project scope that will cover the data analysis and setting the 15 16 17 18 times MOT, the curriculum is huge so i want to show that but not usre how it relates, and then the Rubric is a cool tool that needs to be included but is not a huge portion of the project.  what's the new chapter structure?

📚 NEW CHAPTER STRUCTURE:

Performance evaluation criteria
Quality assurance mechanisms
Standardized assessment procedures
Project Scope and Deliverables (3.13)
Comprehensive data analysis scope (78 analyses, 312 files)
MOT table development coverage
Curriculum integration scope
Rubric evaluation scope
Key Academic Enhancements:
Curriculum Integration:
Shows how data collection supports the comprehensive Malaysian swimming curriculum
Demonstrates integration with LTAD pathways
Establishes connection between data analysis and curriculum development
Rubric Evaluation:
Positions rubric as a complementary assessment tool
Shows integration with data validation process
Demonstrates quality assurance through rubric-based evaluation
Project Scope Clarity:
Clearly defines the massive scope (78 analyses, 312 files)
Shows how curriculum integration works within the methodology
Positions rubric as a supporting tool rather than main focus
Academic Strengths:
Comprehensive Scope: Shows the full breadth of your project
Curriculum Integration: Demonstrates practical application to Malaysian swimming development
Tool Integration: Shows how rubric evaluation supports the broader methodology
Methodological Rigor: Maintains academic standards while showing practical application
