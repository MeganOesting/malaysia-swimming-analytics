Malaysia Medal Pathway

A data-driven system to identify, track, and invest in swimmers with the highest potential to deliver international medals for Malaysia

Current Malaysia Qualification Criteria
Bakat: Under Construction, to follow

Pelapis: 20 Roster Slots for athletes ages 21 and under determined as the best investments to produce SEA Games Medals in 2-4 Years as presented by the association and accepted by the Sports Council

Podium: Unlimited Roster Slots for athletes having posted a time faster than the previous SEA Games Bronze medal in an event.

Current Malaysia Qualification Criteria - Critical Issues
Lacks Specificity to Swimming and its Events: Selection criteria lack specificity to swimming and its events, ignoring event-specific peak ages and limiting athletes’ full development by using a generalized all-sport age of 21.
Lacks Data Based Standards:  Criteria not relevant to international  performance trends and proven progression benchmarks.
Lacks Development Alignment:  Pelapis eligibility ends several years before the statistical peak of development and short of the typical SEA Games medalist age range, leaving medal-track athletes without support during crucial performance-maturing years.


Malaysia Qualification Criteria Objectives

Define clear, evidence-based standards for Bakat, Pelapis, and Podium using valid data to map progression benchmarks.
Align athlete support with peak performance ages, sustaining support through peak medal years.
Provide transparent, consistent criteria so stakeholders know exactly how qualification and continued support are determined.
Maximize medal return on investment by funding athletes with verified medal potential through to full development.


Model: Canada On Track Methodology and Vision 

Introduced in 2013, this data driven system: 
Draws on over two million world-class performances from international competitions to identify developing athletes with the highest potential to impact international results.
Directs resources to those most likely to attain federation desired outcomes.
Determines funding based on average progression rates of Canadian age-group swimmers On Track to attain World Aquatics A standards.
Creates a seamless path from talent identification to Podium roster qualification.

Key Takeaway: Across all events and genders, Track 1 entries consistently show a 4-year progression length, Track 2 entries a 5-year progression length, and Track 3 entries a 6-year progression length. This implies that the sooner an individual achieves an entry-level time, the faster they are likely to reach the 'A standards' for that event.

Now, notice each event has three tracks, track 1 for those early, normal, and late developers on track 3.  The age range for each event is as follows.  How does this relate to the average medal ages at SEA Games (based on the last 3 games) and the recent world top ten averages by event? (Ranked by SEA Games Medal Age)

Negative means the swimmers in SEA are not staying with the event or the sport long enough to fully develop in the given event, positive means the event is not backfilling to progress and push the old out.  Canada expects arrival and then assumes they stay to compete for a few years. 
Also the T3 End is basically set at the world top 10 avg age, differences show their own gaps or pathway progressions

System Logic Breakdown
Case Study: Female 50 Free
Malaysia ends development support at age 21:
3 years before Canada does
3 years before the typical age of the World Top 10
7 years before the typical age of the SEA Games medalists

The “arrival age” for the Female 50 Free is 24, the typical age of the worlds top swimmers

Funding stops during critical athlete development years and years before the typical medal-winning age in most events.
Support ends just as Pelapis and Bakat investments should be returning results.
The medal pipeline breaks before athletes reach their peak performance window.


Undermining Medal Potential
Our current model is flawed. It cuts support just as the investment in Pelapis and Bakat should be paying off. It ends funding for athletes still in Track 3 — often years before they typically reach medal-winning age. And in doing so, it undercuts Malaysia’s medal potential.

Pelapis Solution Pathway: Targets and Tracking

Entry Age (15): When Performance Tracking Becomes Predictive
By age 15, most swimmers reach a stage where physical maturity has evened out, and training and skill become the main drivers of improvement rather than natural growth.
By age 15, most swimmers’ physical maturity evens out, reducing large differences in biological age and making training and skill the main drivers of improvement instead of natural growth spurts.
Anchoring at age 15 captures swimmers after physical maturity stabilizes but early enough to guide them before most leave the sport, creating benchmarks that reflect true athletic ability and yield consistent, comparable, and predictive results for future international potential.

We begin a performance pathway only at the age where the data shows that tracking becomes meaningful. For example, it isn’t reliable to project senior potential from how fast a child swam at age 10, when many athletes haven’t even entered the sport yet, some are brand new, and others are growing at very different rates. But by the age where Track 1 begins, the evidence shows that a swimmer achieving those times is generally ‘on track’ making it valid to identify them for monitoring and potential investment.

Pelapis Solution Pathway: Targets and Tracking

Arrival Age (25): When the Development Window Closes
Data shows that swimmers who have not reached benchmark performance by this age are statistically unlikely to do so later.
Performances beyond this point are rare exceptions rather than typical developmental trajectories.

We begin a performance pathway only at the age where the data shows that tracking becomes meaningful. For example, it isn’t reliable to project senior potential from how fast a child swam at age 10, when many athletes haven’t even entered the sport yet, some are brand new, and others are growing at very different rates. But by the age where Track 1 begins, the evidence shows that a swimmer achieving those times is generally ‘on track’ making it valid to identify them for monitoring and potential investment.

Pelapis Solution Pathway: Targets and Tracking

Progression Rates: How Improvement Unfolds 
Improvement is fastest at younger ages and slows as athletes approach peak performance.
Early entrants tend to reach benchmarks more quickly, while later entrants may progress steadily but require more time to achieve the same targets.

Enables fair, standardized comparison across all ages and events.
To make the curve comparable across all events and genders, I converted the progression times into AQUA points. Each swimmer’s actual performance is then compared to the ‘on track’ AQUA point value for their age. The difference gives their position on the curve: a positive number means the swimmer is ahead of track, zero means they are on track, and a negative number means they are behind. For example, a 22-year-old female swimming 26.05 in the 50 free scores 51 points behind the on-track 22-year-old time of 25.48, while an 18-year-old with the same 26.05 time scores 4 points ahead of the on-track 18-year-old time of 26.10.

Working on Yuet Ting’s Long IM, these don’t have to be the exact clusters but it demonstrates the freedom we will have to target events we want to develop in 3-5 years time.

Apply these measures to identify and compare emerging talent so opportunities are given to the most promising athletes.
Define Event Clusters (Example):

Allows us to proactively identify gaps and target event clusters.  For example, 4 years ago we needed to target male Backstrokers and develop them for our Medley Relay.  We have everything but a Backstroker.
