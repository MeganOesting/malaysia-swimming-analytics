## Files Ready for Board Use

### For Opening in Browser:
1. `/statistical_analysis/reports/MOT_Delta_Index.html` — Interactive analysis index
2. `/statistical_analysis/reports/Delta_Comparison_USA_vs_Canada.html` — Global comparison

### For Reading in Text Editor:
1. `/docs/MOT_Dissertation_Summary.txt` — Executive summary (quick read)
2. `/docs/MOT_PhD_Dissertation_Framework.txt` — Full methodology (detailed reference)
3. `/statistical_analysis/COMPLETION_STATUS.md` — Status metrics (proof of completion)

### For Technical Review:
1. `/statistical_analysis/DATABASE_DOCUMENTATION.md` — Database schema
2. `/statistical_analysis/MALAYSIAN_DATA_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` — Implementation roadmap

## What This Consolidation Provides

### Before Consolidation:
- Two duplicate-looking folders (Statistical Analysis vs statistical_analysis)
- Unclear which was current
- Documentation spread across folders
- Board materials not clearly identified
- PhD framework at risk of being lost

### After Consolidation:
- ✅ Single unified `statistical_analysis/` folder = current production work
- ✅ `/docs/` contains critical PhD framework for credibility
- ✅ MASTER.md clearly points to all board materials
- ✅ Migration documentation explains what was moved and why
- ✅ All files verified accessible and complete
- ✅ Old uppercase folder still exists but identified for archiving
- ✅ Zero loss of mission-critical information

---

## Next Step: Phase 5 - Archive Uppercase Folder

Once you confirm this consolidation is complete and successful, Phase 5 will:

1. Move or delete the uppercase `Statistical Analysis/` folder
2. Create timestamp-marked archive if desired: `Statistical_Analysis_Old_20251118.archive`
3. Confirm uppercase folder is no longer needed

**No data loss** — All critical files already copied to `/docs/`

---

## Board Presentation Use Case

**When presenting to board:**

1. Open MASTER.md → Board Presentation Materials section
2. Start with: `/docs/MOT_Dissertation_Summary.txt` — 2-min read of framework
3. Show: `/statistical_analysis/reports/MOT_Delta_Index.html` — Interactive analysis
4. Demonstrate: `/statistical_analysis/COMPLETION_STATUS.md` — 84/84 complete with 24,928 athletes
5. Deep dive (if asked): `/docs/MOT_PhD_Dissertation_Framework.txt` — Full methodology
6. Technical (if needed): `/statistical_analysis/DATABASE_DOCUMENTATION.md` — System architecture

**All materials are consolidated, verified, and ready for professional presentation.**

**Verification Status**: ✅ **PHASE 4 COMPLETE - ALL FILES VERIFIED AND ACCESSIBLE**

**Ready for Phase 5**: Archive old uppercase folder
